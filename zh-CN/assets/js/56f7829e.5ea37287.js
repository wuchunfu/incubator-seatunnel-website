The failure of a task will only affect its upstream and downstream tasks, which avoids task failures that cause the entire job to fail or rollback. At the same time, SeaTunnel Engine also supports data cache for scenarios where the source data has a storage time limit. When the cache is enabled, the data read from the source will be automatically cached, then read by the downstream task and written to the target.
